Use this parameter to limit the IP address to this location. IP addresses cannot move between network border groups.</p>  <p>Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html">DescribeAvailabilityZones</a> to view the network border groups.</p>  <p>You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic.
