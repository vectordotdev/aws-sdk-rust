For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-account-settings.html">Account Settings</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>When <code>serviceLongArnFormat</code>, <code>taskLongArnFormat</code>, or <code>containerInstanceLongArnFormat</code> are specified, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and resource ID format of the resource type for a specified user, role, or the root user for an account is affected. The opt-in and opt-out account setting must be set for each Amazon ECS resource separately. The ARN and resource ID format of a resource is defined by the opt-in status of the user or role that created the resource. You must turn on this setting to use Amazon ECS features such as resource tagging.</p>
/// <p>When <code>awsvpcTrunking</code> is specified, the elastic network interface (ENI) limit for any new container instances that support the feature is changed. If <code>awsvpcTrunking</code> is turned on, any new container instances that support the feature are launched have the increased ENI limits available to them. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container-instance-eni.html">Elastic Network Interface Trunking</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>
/// <p>When <code>containerInsights</code> is specified, the default setting indicating whether Amazon Web Services CloudWatch Container Insights is turned on for your clusters is changed. If <code>containerInsights</code> is turned on, any new clusters that are created will have Container Insights turned on unless you disable it during cluster creation.

/// <p>Amazon ECS is introducing tagging authorization for resource creation. Users must have permissions for actions that create the resource, such as <code>ecsCreateCluster</code>. If tags are specified when you create a resource, Amazon Web Services performs additional authorization to verify if users or roles have permissions to create tags. Therefore, you must grant explicit permissions to use the <code>ecs:TagResource</code> action.
