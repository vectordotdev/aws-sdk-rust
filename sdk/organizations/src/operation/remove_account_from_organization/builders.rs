The organization's management account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it's removed from the organization.</p>

/// <li> <p>You can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is <i>not</i> automatically collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. Amazon Web Services uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) Amazon Web Services activity that occurs while the account isn't attached to an organization. To remove an account that doesn't yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the steps at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#leave-without-all-info"> To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided</a> in the <i>Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li>
/// <li> <p>The account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator account for any Amazon Web Services service enabled for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.</p> </li>
/// <li> <p>After the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. Amazon Web Services accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.</p> </li>
