*AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication for Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices, wireless devices, and smart appliances) to connect to the AWS Cloud over MQTT, HTTPS, and LoRaWAN.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).
